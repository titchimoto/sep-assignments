1. What is Spatial Locality and why does it benefit performance?

Spacial Locality refers to the concept of how data is stored in memory, and the physical address of data being in close proximity.
For example, with an array, data is stored consecutively in memory, meaning that is a little less flexible in terms of storage, but much more efficient to retrieve because it is stored consecutively.

2. Here are the results from my Array & LinkedList Benchmarking tests:

              user     system      total        real
Create Array  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.001658)
Create LinkedList  1.720000   0.000000   1.720000 (  1.728010)
              user     system      total        real
Find 5000th Item Array  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000002)
Find 5000th Item LinkedList  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000418)
              user     system      total        real
Remove 5000th Item Array  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000008)
Remove 5000th Item LinkedList  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000811)

Through my benchmarking tests, it appeared that arrays were significantly more efficient at creating a 10,000 element structure. 
Whilst accessing or removing specific elements was more comparable in terms of efficiency, it still seemed that arrays completed these operations quicker than the linked list.

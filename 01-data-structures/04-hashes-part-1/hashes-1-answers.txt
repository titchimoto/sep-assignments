Explain why doubling the size of the underlying array of your HashClass may be a poor idea.

As mentioned in the hints of the assignment, the first issue that springs to mind is that for 
smaller array sizes (i.e 2, 4, 8 etc.) a double in size is not that drastic, but as the array becomes
larger, this doubling becomes more of an issue. As we already know, arrays are stored consecutively in
memory, therefore, doubling from 512, to 1024, for example, requires a much larger proportion of memory to be reserved.
This becomes inefficient when, for example, we may only require 257 slots in our array, but by doubling every time, our
array size increases from 256 to 512, leaving precious allocated memory unused.
In our example, this may also be inefficient, as doubling the array size each time requires each item to be
recalculated and repositioned in the array, leading to costly memory re-allocation operations.
